This application uses a traditional game loop & raycasting to achieve a pseudo-3D "map". Made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and some trigonometry. Use the arrow keys to move forward, back, left & right.

An implementation in C with textures & improved controls can be found [here](https://github.com/emboiko/C_Raycast)
